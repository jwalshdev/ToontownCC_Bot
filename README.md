# ToontownCC_Bot
This is a fork of some repo I found from 2020. I recommend knowing at least a bit of python if you want to use this. <b>IT WILL LIKELY NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX</b>

This repository will have bots to these categories:
    <li>~ Gag Training Bot: (Need to add some broader uses, it is a very tailored script right now)</li>
    <li>_ Trolley Bot: (Some of this is done in the original repo, but I could not get it to work so I scrapped it. Will revisit)</li>
    <li>_ Pet Training Bot: (Train Doodle)</li>
    <li>_ Racing Bot: (Still Planning)</li>
    <li>_ Golf Bot: (Still Planning (might scrap))</li>
</ol>

<b>Gag Training Bot Guide</b>

NOTE: To use this bot, you will likely have to perform a bit of set up. If you attempt to run this and get any errors 
about not being able to locate an image, you likely need to replace all of the images with ones from your computer.
You will also need to make template images of your own for any gags that are not bike horn, whistle or bugle)
<li>Enter Barnacle Boulevard gag shop</li>
<li>Activate GagTrainer.py</li>
<li>Sit back and enjoy!</li>
